# Agritime

There's nothing better than spending a Sunday afternoon relaxing by engaging in an intensely competitive game with those I most love.

But there's a problem.

My Dad takes really, Really, REALLY long turns sometimes. Especially while playing [Agricola](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricola_(board_game)>). He is quite... strategic.

Enter <b>Agritime</b>â€” a multi-player chess clock that keeps Dad honest. Agritime keeps track of the amount of time each player has taken in the entirety of the game. By using Agritime, we now know just how much time we each take throughout the game.

## Yet another chess clock??

Yes. I searched, but never found a multi-player chess clock that fit our needs.

Agritime supports the following:

- No ads, No account, no subscriptions
- Multiple players (up to... infinity?)
- Only 1 device needed, but seamless sharing/inviting is supported
- Easy to reorder turn-order by drag-n-drop
- Easy to stop, start, and change timer
